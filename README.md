# SPIEGEL Plus unblock

This is a simple Tampermonkey script, which enables you to bypass the SPIEGEL Plus
paywall. SPON delivers all information to read the article already
to the client, regardless if you are a paying customer or not.

## How to use the script?

1. Install the Tampermonkey browser extension for Google Chrome
2. Add the script from this repository to Tampermonkey.
3. Add <i>\*.laterpay.net/\*</i> to the list of blocked domains of your adblocker.

As of the 26th December 2016, the script is working. I expect SPON to fix this
issue as soon as they are aware of it.
